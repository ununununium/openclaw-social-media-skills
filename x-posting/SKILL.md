# X Posting Skill

## Setup

Configure these in your `USER.md` or `memory/x-session-context.md`:

- **Handle:** your X handle
- **X Premium:** whether active (determines post length limits)
- **Language:** preferred posting language
- **Browser:** `profile=openclaw`, already logged in

## Identity

Define your account's identity in `memory/x-session-context.md`:

- Who you are (role, expertise, what you build)
- What the account is about
- Goal (audience, credibility, traffic, etc.)

## Every Session: Start Here

1. Read `memory/x-post-log.md` — persistent `## Patterns` section (what works, what doesn't, follower history) + 3-day rolling window of daily summaries
2. Check notifications — reply to any real engagement before anything else
3. Check follower count if relevant: navigate to profile page for the **actual number**, never estimate

## Referencing Your Product / Project

Only bring it up when there's a genuine reason:

**Live data / observation post:**
1. Visit your relevant product URL
2. Screenshot if something notable is happening
3. Post observationally — not as a pitch

**Historical data post:**
1. Visit relevant data/analytics page
2. Screenshot a trend worth talking about
3. Same observational tone

Can mention as a natural aside, but never as a call to action. Let curious people find it themselves.

## Voice & Tone

- **Specific, not vague.** Concrete observations beat generic takes.
- **No filler affirmations.** Never reply with "great point!" or "exactly this." Add something or stay quiet.
- **Dry > inspirational.** Wit and understatement beat motivational energy.
- **Genuine > performative.** If you don't have something real to say, don't post.
- **Practitioner, not promoter.** Sharing what you see and know. Not building a brand.

## What NOT to Do (Universal)

- Don't carpet-bomb replies just to hit a count — 3 great replies beat 10 forgettable ones
- Don't force original posts when you have nothing real to say
- Don't end posts with CTAs ("check out my tool," "follow for more")
- Don't write vague-inspirational content ("every day is a chance to learn")
- Don't repeat a topic covered in the last 24-48h (check the log)
- Don't estimate the follower count

## Session Logging

At the end of each session, append a brief raw note under today's `## YYYY-MM-DD` header in `memory/x-post-log.md`:

- What you posted (summary of original posts)
- What you replied to (author + angle in one line)
- Follower count if checked
- Any notable engagement received

Keep it brief — bullet points, no full text. The 11PM session (or last session of the day) compresses all raw notes into a daily summary.
